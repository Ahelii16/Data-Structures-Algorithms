Do you have a knack for programming? Do Data Structures and Algorithms excite you? Well, you have come to the right place. This repository holds a collection of all the famous Data Structures and Algorithms you'd ever find(WIP).

As a part of Hacktoberfest 2018, you have a chance to contribute to this repository and get familiar with the Open Source culture.

## How to contribute
1. Create an issue about the Data Structure/Algorithms or its application you'd like to implement.
2. Wait for any of the maintainers to give you the green signal
3. Code your heart out
4. Create a pull request
5. You're done!

## Steps for contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the forked repository ```git clone https://github.com/<username>/Data-Structures.git```
3. Create a new branch for working ```git branch branch_name``` and switch to the branch ```git checkout branch_name```
4. Code!
5. Save your changes ```git add .```
6. Commit your code ```git commit -m "Single line description of what you did"```
7. Push your code ```git push origin branch_name```
8. Create a pull request
9. Wait for it to get merged!

## Rules for contributing
1. Follow the directory structure 
```Data Structures/Data Structure/language/file and Algorithms/algorithm/language/file```
```Example: Data Structures/Linked List/cpp/linked_list.cpp and Algorithms/Binary Search/rust/binary_search.rs```
2. Format/Indent the code properly
3. Languages accepted: C, C++, Java, Python, Rust (wish to code in another language? Update the README!)
4. Language folder and file names should be lowercase.
5. Documented code is preferred.
6. Only 1 Data Structure/Algorithm per issue/pull request
